* Component - Yo-yo module

A small Yo-yo module to embed Components/Component systems into a
Yo-yo system.

** Dependency

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [jarohen/yoyo.component "0.0.1"]
#+END_SRC

** Usage

For an individual Component:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (:require [yoyo.component :as yc])

  (yc/with-component (map->MyComponent {...})
    (fn [started-component]
      ;; next turtle
      ))
#+END_SRC

The component will be started before being passed to this function,
and stopped afterwards.

For a whole system:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (:require [yoyo.component :as yc]
            [com.stuartsierra.component :as c])

  (yc/with-component-system (c/system-map
                              ...)
    (fn [started-system]
      ;; next turtle
      ))
#+END_SRC

Likewise, the system will be started before being passed to that
function, and stopped afterwards.
