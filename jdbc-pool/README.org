* JDBC Pool - Yo-yo module

This is a module to start a JDBC connection pool in a Yo-yo
system, based on [[http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/][Apache Commons DBCP2]].

** Getting started

Add this in your 'project.clj', as a dependency:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [jarohen/yoyo.jdbc-pool "0.0.1"]
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  {:driver "org.postgresql.Driver" ; optional - we'll guess it if you don't specify one!
   :subprotocol "postgresql"
   :host "..."
   :port 5432
   :username "..."
   :password "..."
   :db "..."
   :max-total 8
   :max-idle 8}
#+END_SRC

This module is currently very basic and so only accepts the options
above - if you want to supply other options to the connection pool,
PRs are very gratefully received!
